# PolygonMLP

This repository contains the code for predicting polygon side length and area using a CNN architecture and an MLP. 

- CNNPolyPredictor.py is the CNN

- GenericDataloader.py is the pytorch dataloader that uses repeated iterators with skipping (See code)

- MLPPolyPredictor.py is the MLP 

- PolygonFactory.py generates the training and testing images, which are polygons of random radius, random number of sides from, and of a certain resolution

- The testing images of resolutions 300/600 

- Train and Test is the training and testing code for both models

Here is a sample polygon of image resolution 300 x 300
